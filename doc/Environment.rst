One of the key functions of this verifier will be to prove that requirements are satisfied in the presence of *environmental variability*. The set of environmental parameters is huge and diverse; this document attempts to capture the variables explored by this verifier.

- Memory layout
- How a program was launched (e.g., variability in argv[0])
- Values in environment variables (e.g., ``PATH``)
- Filesystem contents
